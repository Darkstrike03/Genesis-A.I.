# PROJECT GENESIS A.I.

## REALM: Origin
## GALAXY: Urania
## PLANET: Lystria

Lystria is a planet with life in this galaxy. And this is where our project begins, a planet with rich biome large enough to hold numerous species and their chaos. A planet which has lived long enough to gain personal sentience.

There was total 7 continents in this world, now 6 due to unknown reason carries lives of millions and billions. 

There are many races in this world which we can further divide it into two categories, FERALS (only have instincts) and SENTIENTS (capable of thinking). Now these categories can also be further divided and subdivided, so we should dive right into races.

This race can also be divided into major or minor and we can categorize it based on their number of species or their impact.

MAJOR RACES: Humans, Elves, Dragons, Demons and Animians.

MINOR RACES: Dwarves, Beastkin, Beasts, Monsters, Dragonkin, Vampires, Treants, Fairies, Dryads, Undeads and much more...

## HISTORY:
The history of this planet can be categorized into two parts, one that is know to the normal public and another that is the real one which people with more authorities know.

- *NORMAL HISTORY:*- This is the current history that is known by all and believed to be supreme, and we can divide it by the calamity event “DEMON INVASION”. Before the invasion, the major races were, dwarves, vampires, beastkin, dragons and elves. After the invasion it changed to the current we have.
One day a rifts began to open and demons began to pour out of them, they are chaotic yet intelligent beings who only sought, chaos and blood. At first everything was under control but with time people realized that they are never ending. But when they realized it was too late. Demons cannot be killed by normal ways, and they can be born again in the realm with their memory warped and as new.
This never-ending horde was eventually ended by efforts of all the species and with the emergent of dragon king Iginirs, the golden dragon, a new but powerful species called Animian (which people didn’t knew existed), but many races paid price too.
During this time new leaders emerged and society was formed. A human king, named Arthur who took the surname Lysandor rise and united the human race and rise as a major race, dwarves lost and reduced to minor race, the vampire king, retreated and created a realm for his race, new species like dark elves, monsters like kijin, dijin, orc, orges, and so many rise. Many things happened and chaos came to an end and started the era of cold war.

- *REAL HISTORY:*- It can be said there is not too much changes with the main fact being the invasion cannot be called an invasion in a correct sense.
Few races’ individuals, like dwarves, beastkins, some humans reached their peak and got no way to take the next step, so during the experiment to break their level few experiments were conducted which eventually led to breaking the barrier which separated the demon realm and real world and this demon invasion took place. 

##CURRENT SITUATION:
Currently the six continents are divided with the 5 major races and 1 minor races. 

-*CONTINENT 1:*-Solwynd- Human kingdom (partial-neutral)
-*CONTINENT 2:*-Sylvareth- Elven kingdom (racist)
-*CONTINENT 3:*-Ignaroth- Dragon kingdom (partial-neutral)
-*CONTINENT 4:*-Zor’Maleth- Demon kingdom (racist-neutral)
-*CONTINENT 5:*-Automaris- Animian kingdom (neutral-racist)
-*CONTINENT 6:*-Veridorn- chaos zone or neutral kingdom(neutral)

The new age or what we can call it post-invasion age or the present time, is the time for healing. Races are getting more oriented, amassing power, and more organized. Everything is on track.
