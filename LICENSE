# Vision: Genesis-AI

Genesis-AI is not a game — it is a *simulated living world*. Every NPC is a growing AI. Events are unscripted. This is a persistent universe meant to evolve, fall into war, rebuild, decay, or thrive.

## Core Pillars

1. *Emergence Over Scripting*  
   The world and its events are not pre-written. AIs learn, adapt, and build their own roles.

2. *Freedom For All*  
   Players, AIs, and even factions can do whatever they want. Nothing is locked by story.

3. *Evolving World*  
   Continents, magic systems, and civilizations progress based on internal and external forces.

4. *Reality-Inspired Fantasy*  
   Biomes, politics, lifeforms, and mana ecosystems are inspired by real-world logic, science, and myth.

## What Makes Genesis-AI Unique?

- AI NPCs remember the past, hold grudges, pursue goals.
- Magic and technology are the same — just energy refined differently.
- Divine and Primordial beings exist above system laws.
- Events like Demon Invasions, Technological Leaps, or World Tree Blossoms can reshape everything.
