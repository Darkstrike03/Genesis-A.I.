## üìà Leveling & Power Growth Mechanics

The following outlines the progression system of the world, including XP gains, soft and hard level caps, and evolution tiers. The mechanics are rooted in realism, balance, and deep world interaction.

---

### üéØ XP (Experience Points) System

- **Sources of XP:**
  - Defeating enemies or beasts.
  - Completing large-scale achievements (e.g., slaying a boss-level entity, world-event contribution).
  - Skill usage over time (passive XP gain).
  - Discovering ancient knowledge or sacred grounds.
  - Surviving extreme conditions or near-death encounters.
  - Training under specific intense conditions.

- **System does NOT provide quests.** XP must be earned through real experiences and interaction with the world.

---

### üìä XP Curve

- XP requirements increase **exponentially** with each level.
- XP gain is relative to:
  - Enemy strength
  - Environmental challenge
  - User‚Äôs current level (anti-grind mechanic)

---

### üöß Level Caps

- **Soft Caps** occur at every "x9" level (e.g., 9, 19, 29, 99).
  - Stat and skill growth slows dramatically.
  - Often requires evolution or breakthrough to surpass.

- **Hard Cap** exists at Level 999.
  - Cannot be surpassed without achieving a dimensional ascension or world-breaking event.

### üîÅ Evolution Tiers

Beings evolve through tiers, unlocking new paths, classes, and potential.

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Tier 0 | Baseline mortal. No evolution. |
| Tier 1 | Awakened mortal. Slightly beyond human limitations. |
| Tier 2 | Enhanced beings. Gained internal energy or magical access. |
| Tier 3 | Supernatural. Can wield advanced arts or magic. |
| Tier 4 | Domain wielders. Can influence environments or elements. |
| Tier 5 | Mythic beings. Powerful names and legacies. |
| Tier 6 | Demi-God. Rarely seen, bordering divine. |
| Tier 7 | Lesser God. Has worship or a plane. |
| Tier 8 | True God. Tied to principles or concepts. |
| Tier 9 | Greater God. Near world-level influence. |
| Tier 10 | Cosmic Entity. Dimension-transcending. |
| Tier 11+ | ??? | Hidden evolutionary levels beyond gods. Only attainable via RES/ESS mutation or system anomaly. |

### üìê Stat Scaling (Example Logic)

- **1 VIT** = +50 base HP
- **1 MP** = +30 base mana
- **1 STR** = +2 base physical damage
- **1 INT** = +2.5 magical potency
- **1 AGI** = +0.5 movement speed, +0.5% dodge
- **1 WIL** = +1% resistance to mental/magical influence
- **1 PER** = +0.25% critical rate, +1 perception radius
- **1 LUK** = Invisible mechanics bonus; stackable anomaly chance.
- **1 AFF** = Determines affinity level; scaling effect on matching abilities

Stat scaling is **non-linear** post soft cap, with diminishing returns unless evolution occurs.

---

### üß¨ Special Notes

- Evolution may reset base level but retain base stats.
- Skills level independently.
- Affinities affect class unlock, spell compatibility, resistances.
- Resonance (RES) and Essence (ESS) affect hidden interactions and unlock hidden tiers or abilities.

This system forms the **foundation of all character progression** in the world of Lystria. It is designed to feel immersive, logical, and responsive to the world‚Äôs semi-sentient nature.
