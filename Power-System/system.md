# üåç System Overview (Genesis A.I.)

## üìå Origin of the System
- The **planet Lystria**, over a long evolutionary course, gradually developed **sentience**.
- To better manage its existence, Lystria gave birth to a divine being‚Äî**the Mother Goddess**‚Äîas a fragment of itself.
- The **System** was created by the Mother Goddess to organize, regulate, and guide life, energy, and evolution across the world.
- This System is intricately **bound to the planet itself**, making it omnipresent and active in all things‚Äîdirt, air, water, plants, animals, people, and mana.
- **The World and the Goddess are one**, with the Goddess acting as an interface for the world‚Äôs low-level sentience to grow and evolve.
- Only **Primordials** (e.g., ancient dragons, demons, the Goddess) can communicate with the World directly. Everyone else interacts through the System.

## üß¨ System Characteristics
- Functions like a **game-based interface** with statistics, classes, and evolution paths.
- Sentient beings can access their stats via the **System Interface**.
- Some features are hidden or locked unless specific conditions are met (e.g., evolution, blessings, ancient bloodlines).
- Inspired by:
  - **80%**: *The Death Mage Who Doesn‚Äôt Want a Fourth Time*
  - **15%**: *Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyusoukyoku*
  - **5%**: *Card Apprentice Daily Log* (without the card system)
- The world and System react to major changes, similar to *That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime*.
