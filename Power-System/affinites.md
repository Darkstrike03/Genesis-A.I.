⚛️ Affinities: The Basics
-------------------------

### 📌 What is an Affinity?

Affinity is a **natural alignment or sensitivity** an individual (or even a creature, object, or region) has toward a **particular type of energy or element** in the world. It affects:

*   **What classes they can evolve into**
*   **What spells or skills they can learn or master**
*   **How fast they grow in specific areas**
*   **How the world/system responds to them (e.g., divine favor, resistances)**

* * *

🌈 Types of Affinities
----------------------

We can divide affinities into **3 broad categories** for now (more can be added later):

### 1. **Elemental Affinities**

These are the most common and widely known. Each person may have one or more.

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🔥 Fire | Aggression, destruction, transformation. |
| 💧 Water | Adaptability, healing, control, flow. |
| 🌬 Air | Speed, freedom, range, invisibility. |
| 🌱 Wood | Growth, life, nature, symbiosis. |
| 🪨 Earth | Defense, strength, endurance. |
| ⚡ Lightning | Burst, reaction, energy transfer. |
| ❄ Ice | Control, status effects, stillness. |
| ☠ Dark | Decay, curse, shadow, absorption. |
| 🌟 Light | Purity, healing, revelation. |
| 🌀 Void/Null | Suppression, sealing, anti-magic. |
| 🪶 Sound | Vibration, control, illusions. |
| 🪐 Space | Distance, teleportation, spatial warping. |
| ⏳ Time | Aging, speeding/slowing, rewind (rare/legendary). |
| ☯ Chaos/Order | Universal balance or imbalance (myth-tier). |

* * *

### 2. **Conceptual/Spiritual Affinities**

These affinities usually awaken later or under special conditions:

*   🩸 **Blood** – Vampirism, cursecraft, lineage-based power.
*   ⚙ **Machine/Construct** – For artificial beings or those in symbiosis with relics.
*   🧠 **Mind/Illusion** – For mental manipulation, dreams, and willpower control.
*   🐉 **Draconic** – Tied to dragons and their descendants.
*   👁 **Soul** – Deep resonance, rare and unstable.
*   🧿 **Divine** – Linked to celestial beings and sacred domains.
*   🦴 **Death** – Entropic force, necromancy, spiritual decay.
*   🗡 **Sword** – Mythic weapon alignment; users transcend physical weapon mastery.
*   👹 **Demonic** – Often tied to ancient evils, rage, corruption, or forbidden knowledge.
*   👻 **Ghost/Spirit** – Intangible resonance, haunting, lingering souls.
*   🐾 **Beast** – Can either:
    - Increase affinity with beast-like transformations or instincts.
    - Improve connection with beasts for taming, summoning, or communication.

* * *

### 3. **Unique/Hybrid Affinities**

*   Can be formed through evolution, divine blessing, mutation, or essence fusion.

Examples:

*   Magma (Fire + Earth)
*   Storm (Air + Lightning)
*   Frost (Water + Ice)
*   Celestial (Light + Time)
*   Plague (Dark + Nature)

* * *

🧬 Affinity Grades
------------------

Each affinity has a **grade** (how strong the individual connection is):

*   ❌ None
*   🟫 Low
*   🟦 Moderate
*   🟩 High
*   🟨 Superior
*   🔶 Unique
*   🌌 Mythical (Extremely rare)

* * *

📈 Affinity Detection & Awakening
---------------------------------

*   **Default at birth**, but some can **awaken later** through:
    *   Extreme emotion or life-or-death experiences
    *   System-triggered resonance
    *   Training with artifacts or ancient scrolls
    *   Divine trials
    *   Mutation or Essence interference

*   **Inherited, gained, or practiced** – Affinity can be passed down genetically, increased via training, or modified through powerful treasures.

* * *

💡 How It Works with Classes
----------------------------

*   Certain classes require **minimum affinity levels**.

    *   🔥 Pyromancer → High Fire Affinity
    *   🌊 Aquamancer → Moderate Water Affinity
    *   🌪 Spellblade → Dual Affinity (Air + Sword-type physical)
    *   🐾 Beast Tamer → Beast Affinity

*   Unique and mythic classes (like **Sword God**) have exclusive traits:
    *   A Sword God can dominate any sword-type weapon through resonance.
    *   A Dragon with Storm Affinity may nullify all spells under Unique-grade Lightning.
    *   Divine- or Myth-tier classes often reshape battlefields and mechanics.

*   World/system will often **favor** those with high resonance in their affinity, bending rules or interactions in subtle or grand ways.

*   Affinity may also unlock **racial traits**, **hidden paths**, or even **break the system** in rare mythic cases.
