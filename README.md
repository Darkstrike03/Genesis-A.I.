# Genesis-A.I.
An A.I.-driven world simulation fantasy project
# Genesis-AI

Genesis-AI is a persistent, intelligent simulation-world where *AI-powered NPCs* shape the story, politics, and culture of a vast and evolving fantasy universe. Players are not the center — they are just another part of the world.

Every element of the world — from dragons to divine beings — is grounded in deep lore, systemic magic, and learning AI that reacts, adapts, and remembers.

### Features

- AI-driven NPCs with memory and growth
- A living world with planes, factions, biomes, and evolving history
- Magical technology (Magitech) and soul-bound interfaces
- Autonomous world evolution, conflict, and politics
- Full sandbox player freedom — shape, destroy, or simply exist

### Timeline

The current era is *3005 P.E. (Peace Era)* — 500 years after the devastating Demon Invasion.
